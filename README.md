The provided code demonstrates how to implement K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification using the Iris dataset in Python with Scikit-learn. It begins by loading the dataset and selecting the first two features for easier 2D visualization. The features are normalized using StandardScaler, and the data is split into training and testing sets. The KNeighborsClassifier is then trained and evaluated using different values of K (from 1 to 9), with model performance measured using accuracy and a confusion matrix. Finally, the decision boundary for a chosen value of K (e.g., K=3) is visualized using a mesh grid and color mapping, showing how the KNN algorithm separates different classes in the feature space. This implementation helps in understanding the effect of K on model accuracy and how KNN classifies data based on proximity in feature space.
